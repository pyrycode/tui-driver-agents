# tui-driver Agents — Working Notes

This is the agent-prompts + dispatcher-launcher repo for the [pyrycode/tui-driver](https://github.com/pyrycode/tui-driver) project (Go library for PTY-driving interactive `claude` CLI sessions). The target Go source lives in a sibling clone at `../tui-driver/`. The dispatcher source lives in [`pyrycode/agent-dispatcher`](https://github.com/pyrycode/agent-dispatcher) — a separate repo consumed via git submodule at `dispatcher/`, shared identically across all pyrycode-org agent forks (`pyrycode/agents`, `pyrycode-mobile-agents`, `pyrycode-relay-agents`, this one).

This repo holds the per-agent CLAUDE.md prompts (architect/, developer/, code-review/, documentation/, po/), the `bin/` launcher scripts, and the `.env` config that drives the dispatcher against the tui-driver project board.

Forked from `pyrycode/agents@00b6ef3` on 2026-05-16. Sync flows back from upstream per [vault: Agent Fork Sync Procedure](https://github.com/pyrycode/agents/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) — dispatcher submodule bumps propagate immediately (Flow A); prompt syncs are cherry-picked manually (Flow B). tui-driver targets Go, same as the upstream pyrycode core, so prompt adaptations should be minimal — mostly just paths and project-naming.

## Dispatcher source layout

The dispatcher's pure-function helpers are split across five files; `lib.ts` is a thin barrel re-export.

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `dispatcher/src/pipeline-decisions.ts` | Auto-advance rules + decision, rework routing, done-cleanup, post-run labels, label predicates, rework-target extraction, rework-loop circuit breaker, advance-rule lookup |
| `dispatcher/src/agent-runtime.ts` | `shouldUseWorktree`, `maxTurnsFor`, salvage gating (`shouldAttemptSafeSalvage`, `findReadyPrNumber`, `extractRateLimitInfo`), `SPAWN_ENV_DENYLIST` + `scrubSpawnEnv` |
| `dispatcher/src/worktree.ts` | `shouldAutoCommit`, `decideCodegraphSymlink`, `decideBranchSetup`, `findWorktreesForBranch`, `resolveAgentsRepoRoot`, `resolveTargetRepoRoot` |
| `dispatcher/src/blockers.ts` | `hasOpenBlockers`, `shouldSkipBlockedFor`, `shouldProduceCommits`, `parseCommitsAhead`, `shouldFlagEmptyBranch` |
| `dispatcher/src/dispatch-selection.ts` | `AGENT_COLUMN_MAP`, `selectDispatches` |
| `dispatcher/src/lib.ts` | Barrel re-export only (kept one cycle for `dispatch.ts` + tests) |

Cross-file deps form a clean DAG: pipeline-decisions → blockers; dispatch-selection → pipeline-decisions + blockers; worktree and agent-runtime are leaves.

**New code:** prefer importing from the specific module (`from "./pipeline-decisions.js"`) over the barrel. The barrel's `export * from` lineup will likely shrink once `dispatch.ts` and tests have flipped to direct imports.

## Use codegraph for dispatcher-side reading

`pyrycode/agents/` is indexed for codegraph (`.codegraph/`, gitignored). Default to `mcp__codegraph__codegraph_*` MCP tools for symbol-level questions before reaching for grep:

- **Before changing or removing any exported function** — run `codegraph_callers <name>` to find the call sites across `dispatch.ts`, `reconcile.ts`, sibling lib files, and the test files. The dispatcher's pure-function decomposition means a "small" rename typically fans out to 3–5 sites.
- **Before extending `dispatch.ts` with a new post-run handler** — run `codegraph_callees <name>` against neighbouring handlers (`decidePostRunLabels`, `runAutoAdvance`, `runReworkRouting`) to mirror their shape.
- **For "where is this used / what calls what" across the dispatcher** — `codegraph_context "<area phrase>"` returns the entry points + related symbols faster than reading the files end-to-end.

The same fall-back rules apply as in agent CLAUDE.mds: use grep/Read for comments, string literals, docs, or pending edits the canonical index doesn't yet reflect.

**Re-index when finished:** the dispatcher's worktree symlink (`decideCodegraphSymlink` in `worktree.ts`) points spawned agents at the canonical `.codegraph/`. After a substantive change to dispatcher source, run `codegraph index -f` from `agents/` so the next dispatcher run sees the new symbols. (`codegraph sync` doesn't always pick up changes — confirmed 2026-05-09.)

**Querying from a different cwd (e.g. the vault):** the codegraph MCP tools accept a `projectPath` argument — pass `/Users/<you>/Workspace/Projects/pyrycode/agents` to query the dispatcher from any session, regardless of where Claude Code was launched. Without `projectPath` the MCP server falls back to CWD, which usually isn't the project root.

## Test-first

Test-first applies to dispatcher edits as much as it does to dispatched developer agents. RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. Failing test in `lib.test.ts` (or `reconcile.test.ts`) first; implementation after. Backfilling tests after the fact ships bugs first — see PROJECT-MEMORY's "Straightforward state mutation is a smell phrase" lesson.

The dispatcher is ~1500 lines of pure functions (split across pipeline-decisions / agent-runtime / worktree / blockers / dispatch-selection) plus a thin orchestrator (`dispatch.ts`). Reading the source is cheap; theorizing without reading produces wrong answers (PROJECT-MEMORY: "Read the actual code before guessing").

## Belt-and-suspenders

Every "agent does X" rule needs a deterministic dispatcher-side safety net for X. Two stochastic rules verifying each other share the same failure mode. Recent examples in the pure-function lib + `dispatch.ts`:

- **Empty-branch guard** (`shouldFlagEmptyBranch`) — backstops architect/developer/documentation prose with a deterministic commit-count check
- **Auto-commit safety net** — backstops the agent's "remember to commit" instruction
- **`hasOpenBlockers` predicate** — backstops architect's blocker-detection prose with a deterministic GitHub query

When adding a new agent rule, ask: "what deterministic check enforces this if the agent forgets?" If there isn't one, the rule is advisory only — fine for low-cost cases, expensive for ones that ship broken work downstream.
